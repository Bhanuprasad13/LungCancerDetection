# Lung Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains code for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect lung cancer from medical images. The main implementation is in the Jupyter notebook `LungCancerDetection.ipynb`, which was developed using Google Colab.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook `LungCancerDetection.ipynb` includes the complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation. Here's an overview of the notebook's sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Loading the lung cancer dataset.
   - Preprocessing images (e.g., resizing, normalization).

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Defining and configuring a CNN model for lung cancer detection.
   - Implementing transfer learning using pretrained ResNet architectures.

3. **Training**:
   - Training the CNN model on the dataset.
   - Monitoring training progress with loss and accuracy metrics.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the trained model on a separate validation dataset.
   - Computing performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Making predictions on new images using the trained model.

## Usage

To run the notebook `LungCancerDetection.ipynb`, follow these steps:

1. **Open in Google Colab**:
   - Click on the following link to open the notebook in Google Colab:

2. **Runtime Setup**:
   - Ensure that you have a GPU runtime enabled in Google Colab for faster training (Go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` and select `GPU`).

3. **Execute Cells**:
   - Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and observe outputs.

4. **Modify and Experiment**:
   - Feel free to modify the code, parameters, or dataset paths as per your requirements.
   - Experiment with different model architectures or hyperparameters to improve performance.
